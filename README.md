# NL2LS: LLM-based Automatic Linking of KGs

Can large language models (LLMs) recognize link specifications (LS)? We hypothesize that LS can be considered a low-resource language. In our previous work, we explored how LS can be translated into natural language (NL). Currently, we are investigating the reverse process by translating NL into LS, which we refer to as NL2LS.
