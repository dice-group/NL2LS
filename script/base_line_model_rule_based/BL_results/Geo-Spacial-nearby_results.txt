AND(cosine(x.are_above_52,x.are_above_52)|0.48)
If two entities are adjacent (e.g., next-door buildings) with at least 42% confidence, OR their city and street names are moderately similar (Ratcliff and Jaccard), THEN consider them potentially equivalent
If two geographic areas intersect by at least 69%, OR their street and city names are moderately similar (Ratcliff ≥ 30%, Jaccard ≥ 52%), THEN treat them as linked
AND(overlap(x.geo,x.geo)|0.45)
If the geometries touch at their boundaries with at least 75% likelihood, OR their street names and city names are highly similar (Levenshtein ≥ 52%), THEN these are likely related
If the geometries overlap by 57%, OR the city and street names show strong Ratcliff and cosine similarity, THEN these may refer to the same place
AND(overlap(x.geo,x.geo)|0.80)
AND(jaccard(x.and_city,x.and_city)|0.50)
AND(touch(x.geo,x.geo)|0.82,levenshtein(x.or_city,x.or_city)|0.50,ratcliff(x.and_street,x.and_street)|0.50)
If the geometries are adjacent at 46% confidence, OR the street names are strongly similar (Jaro-Winkler), and city names are similar (Jaccard), THEN link them
If one geometry crosses the other at 56% probability, OR city and street names show moderate Jaccard and Levenshtein similarity, THEN they may be related
If two geometries intersect at 71%, OR city names and street names are strongly similar (Jaccard ≥ 58%, Jaro-Winkler ≥ 40%), THEN treat them as a match
If the geometries cross at 59%, OR the street names and city names are strongly similar (Jaro-Winkler, Levenshtein), THEN the entities likely represent the same place
If the geometries touch at 46%, OR the city and street names (Q-grams, Ratcliff, Cosine) show high similarity, THEN the entities likely refer to the same object
If one geometry contains the other with 82% certainty, OR the street and city names (Jaro-Winkler, Levenshtein, Ratcliff) are all fairly similar, THEN they likely represent the same entity
If two geometries intersect at 82%, OR the city names (cosine ≥ 52%) and street names (Jaro-Winkler ≥ 56%) are highly similar, THEN they are likely the same place
If one geometry contains the other at 56%, OR the city names are highly similar (Levenshtein ≥ 56%), and the street names are moderately similar (Ratcliff), THEN these refer to the same location
If the geometries intersect at 56%, OR the city names (Q-grams and Jaccard) and the street names (Jaro-Winkler) are all somewhat similar, THEN they are considered a match
If the geometries intersect at 72%, OR the city names (Q-grams) and street names (Jaro-Winkler) are both strongly similar, THEN the entities likely describe the same place
